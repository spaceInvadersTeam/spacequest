The Adventure Begins now

## The Game

This project is was made for the SpaceAppChallange2020, for the Create a Mascot Challenge
 
The idea behind this app is provide a framework of the game in which kids can play as they learn about planets
 
Plasmo is an habitant from IO, an in each round he presents you and your friends a random planet, detailing its most relevant characteristics 
Then, everyone have to think and draw a creature that it could be suitable for that planets
At the end of the round, every child will describe it’s creature, explaining his creature and how it can adapt to the planet characteristics.
Then, one by one, they decide which of their teammates' drawings they liked the most, and the chosen player will win a point.
At the end of certain number of rounds, the player with most points wins the game
 
The app currently has a language selection, a main screen with a start, and a “swipe to the right” to see the rules.
When starting the game, a random planet will be displayed, with some basic information, and with a swipe to the right, detailed information will be shown. Another wipe will allow you to play another round
 
The round time (if desired), number of rounds and player score is left to be defined and controlled by the organizer of the game, but we have plans for that feature in future releases.

There is an actually built app for android here: 
https://github.com/spaceInvadersTeam/spacequest/blob/master/releases/app-release.apk
You can just download it directly to your android device and run it

A live demo of the app running on an android device can be seen in the following video:

## What is next

We plan to add game configuration, such as number of rounds and time of the round.
Also, we plan to add player inputs to set the number and name of players, a voting screen and a score screen.
Also we want to introduce Categories, so players can vote once for each category (like, cutest creature, best suitable, best drown, etc), so players can win in different categories.}
And of course, add moons and asteroids.
And many many more features
